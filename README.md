 Notes: should the garden be visible at all times? For the Priority, Planned, Other Spending, you can pick on area to focus on for the user’s story if you like This is going to be a pretty important feature since this is where all the user’s money is going to be seen.

How can we incorporate these features to our app w/o copying Are there areas we missed and need to add?
